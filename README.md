## Presentation

After working for about ten years in accounting, I started to feel a weariness. I had the feeling that I had done all I could do in this profession. I then asked myself what I wanted to do and what would really allow me to develop professionally. I have always had an interest in the field of computer science and more particularly in web development. 

This is why I decided to join the O'clock school, which has been awarded the "grande Ã©cole du numÃ©rique" label.
After several months of learning the essential basics of web development, I chose to focus on the Symfony framework. Indeed, algorithms, creation and manipulation of a database, attracted me from the beginning. It is therefore natural that I followed a back-end speciality.

Today, I want to continue my learning of php and javascript languages, and discover React.
To do so, I decided to join the O'Clock school's training program for application developers.
